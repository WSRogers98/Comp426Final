    <p>UNC Compstone is a card game between two players. 
        The goal of the game is to play cards from your hand onto the board and then 
        use the cards on the board to damage the enemy's grade and eventually bring 
        them down to 0.</p>

    <h4 class="head">Start of the game</h4>
    <p>Each player starts with 7 cards in their hand and 0 on their board. The player 
        that goes first is decided randomly.</p>

    <h4 class="head">Turn progression</h4>
    <p>On a player's turn, they can play cards from their hand onto their board. 
        Each board can only have 7 cards on it at a time. 
        Playing a card from the hand costs health and 
        when a card is played it can't be used to attack until the 
        turn after it is played. Many cards have abilities that are activated upon 
        playing the card from the hand.</p>

    <h4 class="head">End of Game</h4>
    <p>The game ends when one of the players goes down to 0 health.</p>
