## repository problems

we had a lot of logistical issues with github merge requests and how doing them would keep messing up our repository somehow. so insteady we typically used text files to share out work. everyone contributed to this project and worked very hard. I am proud of us all. I wanted to make sure that was known because github caused some issues when doing commits and group particpation may not be accuratelt reflected looking at just that. If you ask me, everyone did an amazing job.
